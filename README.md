### News Aggregator

The News Aggregator, in this scope, scrapes the main news and headlines for local news in the Bronx, from several renowned sites, including the Bronx Times, News12 the Bronx, etc. 


After scrapping up-to-date real-time news from the sites, it has 2 options for the users interacting with this project - one is to read the news form the csv file downloaded from the application used to run the project. This approach is easier for several users. On the other hand, the user might choose to read the csv file back to the terminal and enjoy reading from there!
